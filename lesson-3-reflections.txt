Here are some notes to work with the GitHub commandline API:

Assuming you already have a GitHub account set up, then...

First, set up the ssh public key on GitHub. Test the SSH connection like so:

    % ssh git@github.com

You should see a message like:

    PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
    Hi aturvey! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    Connection to github.com closed.

If not, there is some troubleshooting information on GitHub: https://goo.gl/uDSgNY

You can also use HTTPS, but beware that with 2FA enabled you'll need to have a Personal Access
Token defined (also described in the above link)

Here's how to cache your password with GitHub so that you don't need to use it every single
time. I guess this is analogous to ssh-agent for the session:
