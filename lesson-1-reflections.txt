Finding differences between files.

% tkdiff  /* the easy way */

% diff <file1> <file2>  /* the not as easy way */
% diff -u <file1> <file2>   /* same as above but unified format */

The output of diff -u can be a bit difficult to read. Here is a sample.

file1:
    one
    two
    three

file2:
    one
    2
    three
    four

% diff file1 file1
    2c2
    < two
    ---
    > 2
    3a4
    > four

The way you read this (a little confusing) is '2c2' means line two of file1 changed and is now line 2 of file2. The
'<' is as it appeared in file1 and the '>' is as it appeared in file2. The '---' is a separator. The '3a4' means 
appending after line 3 of file1 is added 'a' to line 4 of file2. The '>' is the new line added. 

Here is the 'unified' output using -u:

% diff -u file1 file2
    --- file1	2016-01-10 19:04:50.000000000 -0500
    +++ file2	2016-01-10 19:04:59.000000000 -0500
    @@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
    one
    -two
    +2
    three
    +four

The --- refers to the original file (first in argument list) and +++ refers to the new file (second in argument list). 
The junk between @@@ means that the output that follows is from lines in range 1,3 of original file and range 1,4 of
the second file. In the text lines that follow, lines beginning with ' ' have no change, line with '-' have been deleted
and lines with '+' have been added. There can also be a '!' which means changed.  

GIT PROMPT and GIT TAB COMPLETION
---------------------------------
There are two very useful files. they are on macbook pro, and probably can be found via google. Abundantly commented.

    .git-profile.sh
    .git-completion.bash

Commands learned in this Lesson
-------------------------------

    % git --version
    % git clone <url>
    % git log 
    % git log --stat
    % git diff <id1> <id2>

Note: when looking at the output from git log be sure to remember that the most recent commit is listed first. 

Some configurations recommended by the Udacity course:
    % git config --global core.editor "vim"
    % git config --global push.default upstream
    % git config --global merg.conflictsytle diff3
